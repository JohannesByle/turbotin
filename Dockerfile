# Create a new stage for running the application that contains the minimal

# image from the build stage where the necessary files are copied from the build
# stage.

# The example below uses the alpine image as the foundation for running the app.
# By specifying the "latest" tag, it will also use whatever happens to be the
# most recent version of that image when you build your Dockerfile. If
# reproducability is important, consider using a versioned tag
# (e.g., alpine:3.17.2) or SHA (e.g., alpine@sha256:c41ab5c992deb4fe7e5da09f67a8804a46bd0592bfdf0b1847dde0e0889d2bff).
